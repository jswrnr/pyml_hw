"""
Dropout regularization layer.

During training, dropout randomly zeroes each element of the input with
probability `p`, then scales the surviving elements by `1 / (1 - p)`.
This "inverted dropout" convention (matching PyTorch's `nn.Dropout`)
keeps the expected value of each activation unchanged, so no rescaling
is needed at evaluation time:

    keep_prob = 1 - p
    mask      = (uniform(0, 1) < keep_prob) / keep_prob   # 0 or 1/keep_prob
    y         = x * mask        (training)
    y         = x               (evaluation)

Because the surviving units are already scaled up during training, the
forward pass is the identity in evaluation mode. The same mask is reused
in the backward pass: gradients flow only through the units that were
kept, scaled by the same `1 / keep_prob` factor.

Dropout holds no trainable parameters. Its behaviour depends on the
`training` flag inherited from `Module`, which the training loop toggles
via `train()` / `eval()`.

DO NOT MODIFY THE FUNCTION SIGNATURES.
